# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Primary Objective**: Create a shareable dashboard system for the existing Cline metrics analysis tool

## Current Status
**Phase**: Initial setup and task creation
- ‚úÖ Memory bank system established
- ‚úÖ Project brief and context documented
- üîÑ Creating comprehensive task breakdown
- ‚è≥ Implementation planning

## Recent Decisions

### Architecture Decision: Local-First Dashboard
- **Decision**: Build local HTML dashboard with image export instead of web-hosted solution
- **Rationale**: Maintains privacy, zero infrastructure requirements, immediate deployment
- **Impact**: Simpler development, better security, works offline

### Technology Stack Decision: Zero Dependencies
- **Decision**: Use pure HTML/CSS/JS with CDN libraries only
- **Rationale**: Maintains the existing tool's philosophy of minimal dependencies
- **Impact**: Easy deployment, no build tools, universal compatibility

### Integration Strategy: Extend Existing Script
- **Decision**: Add `--dashboard` flag to existing `analyze_cline_sessions.py`
- **Rationale**: Preserves existing functionality while adding new capabilities
- **Impact**: Seamless user experience, no workflow disruption

## Active Considerations

### Export Format Optimization
- Need to determine optimal image dimensions for different social platforms
- Consider Twitter (1200x675), LinkedIn (1200x627), Instagram Story (1080x1920)
- GitHub README banners typically 800x400

### Visual Design Priorities
- Hero metrics must be immediately impressive (ROI ratio, value created)
- Charts should tell a story about development efficiency
- Professional color scheme and typography
- Responsive design for screenshot quality

### User Experience Flow
1. User runs existing command with `--dashboard` flag
2. Script generates analysis data + dashboard files
3. Browser opens automatically to display dashboard
4. User clicks export button for desired format
5. Image is saved to exports/ directory

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed task breakdown with implementation phases
2. Begin Phase 1: Enhance Python script for JSON export
3. Create dashboard file structure
4. Implement basic HTML dashboard with professional styling
5. Add Chart.js visualizations
6. Implement image export functionality
7. Test across platforms and optimize

## Dependencies and Blockers
- **None currently identified** - project is well-scoped and technically straightforward
- All required data is already available from existing analysis engine
- Browser-based solution eliminates deployment complexity

## Success Criteria for Current Phase
- Complete task documentation
- Clear implementation roadmap
- Technical architecture validated
- Ready to begin development
